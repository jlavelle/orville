# Orville Oracle

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/flipstone/orville.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/flipstone/orville)

A port of Orville to work with Oracle database.
This is very much a work in progress and many features either do not work or remain untested.

## Features/Functions known to work
   - `selectAll`
   - various forms of where clauses including:
     - `whereAnd`
     - `where_`
     - `whereOr`
   - `updateSql`
   - `insertRecord`*
   - certain column types including:
     - `textField`
     - `numberIntField`
     - `numberDoubleField`

   * Note that `insertRecord` had been modified and does not have the same api as `orville-postgresql`

## Features known to not work
   - `selectFirst`

## Differences from `orville-postgresql`
   - `insertRecord` has been modified and does not return the newly inserted data.
   - `textField`
   - `numberIntField` refers to the Oracle NUMBER column type specified to be an integer
   - `numberDoubleField` refers to the Oracle NUMBER column type specified to be a double

## Untested
   Features not listed above may not have been tested and thus may fail in odd and confusing ways.
   In fact, the tests to not currently even compile.

## Setting Up Local Development

### Downloading Closed Source Bits
    To get started we need a few closed source libraries from Oracle. Unfortunately these are also
    behind a registration wall to download. To get these do the following:
    - Go to this page https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/linux-x86-64-downloads.html
    - download both of the following(instantclient files are gitignored to prevent them from being including in the repo on accident)
      and place them in the orville-oracle directory (alongside this file)
      - instantclient-basic-linux.x64-12.1.0.2.0.zip
      - instantclient-odbc-linux.x64-12.1.0.2.0.zip

### "Purchasing" the Oracle docker image
    You will need to "purchase" the Oracle docker image from docker up for the docker
    commands below to work. There's no actual cost, but you'll need to agree with the
    Oracle license agreement as part of the process to be able pull the image from
    docker hub.

    - Visit https://hub.docker.com/_/oracle-database-enterprise-edition an follow the Proceed
      to Checkout button.

### Starting and Setting up Oracle
    This is a two step process that assumes you are inside the directory along with this file:
    - First, run `docker-compose up --build oracle`
    - The above will give you a notice about the database being up (along with other log output)
    - After the database is up run `./setup-orville-user-oracle-docker.sh`

### Running a development repl
    The `dev` service defined in the `docker-compose.yml` has environment variables setup for running a repl.
    Using your prefered method to get a shell in the container you can then do `stack --stack-yaml stack-lts-13.12.yml ghci`
    to get a repl. The environment variable `TEST_CONN_STRING` has values needed to create a connection pool (i.e.
    the final argument to `createConnectionPool`).
